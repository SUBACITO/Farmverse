Smart Contract:

🌟 First, you need to download the Algorand toolkit. Once downloaded, go to "app.dappflow".

🌟 Create a developer wallet account.

🌟 Upload the smart contract file.

🌟 Transfer a small amount of Algo to the account to run it.

Here, we will use this to store and trade, creating a connection between the game and real life. 🌍
